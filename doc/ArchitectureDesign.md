# Architecture Design #

This topic illustrates the architecture design of the WebSphere Commerce deployment utilities. After reading this topicï¼Œyou will be able to understand how the deployment utilities work and the basic flow of managing multiple WebSphere Commerce V9 environments during varies development phases, including development, QA, Pre-Production, and Production.

<!--For better understand it, there also have a End2End Usage which be draft as a story with several
Role which is more close a real scenario that a team or a company will pass through with DevOps
Utilities. See [End2End Usage Story](End2EndUsage.md)

WebSphere Commerce deployment utilities include the following types of components:

* DeployController, Vault, and Nexus - They are residing on the long run pad to serve continuous business requirement for environment setup, update, and operation.
* SupportContainer and DeploySlave - They are sitting in the temporary run pod, and are deployed on-demand and removed after the job is completed.

All these components are dockerized, so you can easily leverage the Kubernetes platform to deploy the components without manual setup.

WebSphere Commerce deployment utilities leverage the task-scheduling capability of Jenkins and the resource-scheduling capability of Kubernetes.
Thus, when you trigger some long-run or asynchronous job through Jenkins, such as installing Helm or building Docker images,
the pre-defined Jenkins job pipeline will start a  temporary pod using the DeploySlave Docker container. When the job is complete, the temporary Pod is also released.

In deployment Utilises, the concept *Docker Build In Docker* is also introduced, which means, when you start to build customized Docker image, the build process will be launched in a temporary pod with the DeploySalve Docker Image.

The DevOps Utilities are implemented with Python. Each Jenkins job calls a Python script. All python scripts are grouped in a Python package, which is composed of Python modules. You can find the Python modules under `commerce-devops-utilities/utilises`.

## DeployController  ##
DeployController is built as the Jenkins Master and acts as a "hub" to orchestrate deployment job. Its responsibilities include:
1. Connect to Vault to manage environment-related data
2. Connect to Nexus to fetch customized package for building customization Docker Image
3. Connect to Docker Repository to push customized Docker Image
4. Connect to Kubernetes in InCluster Mode to manage environment-related data with ConfigMap (such as environment info / Dockerfile )
5. Connect to Kubernetes and assign Jenkins jobs on the DeploySlave Pod.

When DeployController is started, you need to input the parameters as shown in the following table:

Parameter  | Description
------------- | -------------
VaultUrl |  Vault URL ( e.g. http://9.112.245.194:30552/v1 ). If `InCluster` is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
VaultToken  | Vault Root Token for REST API access . If `InCluster` is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
BundleRepo | Customized package repository. Nexus is the default bundle repository ( e.g.  http://9.110.182.156:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/commerce )
DockerRepo | Docker image repository (e.g. DockerRepoHostname:RepoPort )
KubernetesUrl | Kubernetes URL for remote call from Jenkins. If `InCluster` is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
DockerRepoUser   | User name for logging onto the Docker image repository when downloading the Docker image.
DockerRepoPwd  |User password for logging onto the Docker image repository when downloading the Docker image.
HelmChartsRepo  | Helm Charts Repository for restoring Helm Charts. HelmChartsRepo handles Helm pre- and post-installation hook, and acts as InitContainer to control startup sequence (e.g. http://9.112.245.194:8879/charts)
InCluster | Specifies whether the DeployController is deployed inside or outside of the Kubernetes cluster. If `InCluster` is set to true, DeployController will automatically detect the Vault token and use the default Vault and Jenkins Services. The value can be true or false. False is the default value.

### DeployController configuration ###
You can start DeployController with the default settings:

Parameter  | Description
------------- | -------------
VaultUrl |  Vault URL ( e.g http://9.112.245.194:30552 ). If InCluster is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
VaultToken  | Vault root token for the REST API access. If InCluster is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
BundleRepo | Customize package repository. Nexus is the default bundle repository ( e.g  http://9.110.182.156:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/commerce )
DockerRepo |Docker image repository (e.g DockerRepoHostname:RepoPort )
KubernetesUrl | Kubernetes URL for remote call from Jenkins. If InCluster is set to true, this value is not mandatory.
DockerRepoUser   | User name for logging into the Docker image repository when downloading the Docker image.
DockerRepoPwd  | User Password for logging into the Docker image repository when downloading the Docker image.
HelmChartsRepo  | Helm Charts repository for updating Helm Charts
<!--Tiffany: What is missing?-->| Handles Helm pre- and post- installation hook / Acts as InitContainer to control the startup sequence (e.g http://9.112.245.194:8879/charts)
InCluster |Specifies whether this deploy controler is to be deployed inside or outside of the Kubernetes cluster. if InCluster is set to true, DeployController will automatically detects the Vault token and use the default Vault and Jenkins service. The default value is false.  

### Starting DeployController with no configuration ###

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 deploycontroller:latest
```

When DeployController is started, log in and configure through **Manage Jenkins**>**Configure System**>**Environment variables**.

You can trigger utility jobs through the Jenkins UI. To better integrate with your existing CD pipeline, you can also call DeployController through the web hook or Jenkins API.

## Vault  ##
In the context of WebSphere Commerce deployment, Vault can support third-party applications for the certificate issue services and the Key-Value feature to store environment-related data.

It is suggested to use Vault PKI to present the Certificate Agent, which can automatically issue certificates for each component from the same CA and easily establish secure connections between components.

Vault Key-Value is the default feature in WebSphere Commerce V9. If you set the out-of-box container's configuration mode to `CONFIGURE_MODE=Vault`, the out-of-box container will try to fetch environment data from Vault.

Since V9.0.0.4, WebSphere Commerce can better support ConfigMap, so if you do not want to store the environment data through Vault Key-Value, you can create ConfigMap and mount into the Docker container. <!--See [End2End Usage](End2EndUsage.md)-->

## Nexus ##
In the context of WebSphere Commerce deployment, Nexus can support third-party applications to store and manage customization package. When building customization jobs, if you input
only the bundle version, the backend scripts will try to fetch related customized package from the default configured Nexus server.

## DeploySlave ##
Helm and Dockerd are embedded with DeploySlave. When you launch Jenkins jobs based on input to deploy a new or update an existing WebSphere Commerce V9 environment, the master (DeployController) will assign the job on
an auto-created DeploySlave temporary pod and launch the Helm client.

Similar to launching the job for building the customization Docker image, the job automatically creates a temporary pod, fetches related Dockerfile from dedicated ConfigMap based on the user input, and leverages embedded Dockerd to build new Docker images. To launch the build job for customized Docker, you might need to change the default container size. 20 GB is the capacity for a default Docker container, which is enough for building search or ts-web.
However, if you want to build ts-app, increase the Docker container disk size to a minimum of 30 GB. If you want to build more than one component Docker image at one time, consider to allocate more capacity for the Docker container.

## Helm Charts ##
Helm Chart is the smallest executable component unit for deployment. In DeployController, the Helm repository is the init parameter for startup. During deployment, the Helm repository is passed to DeploySlave. The embedded Helm initializes the Helm Repository in DeploySalve with name stable<!--Tiffany: What is name stable?-->. The deployment UI of DeployController
supports specifying Helm Chart names. You can also specify Helm Chart names through the Jenkins job named "DeployWCSCloud" from the Helm repository.

## SupportContainer ##
SupportContainer can be used in Helm Charts as InitContainer for controlling the component container startup logic to:

1. Run as Helm Pre-Install Hook to create Secret.
2. Run as Helm Pre-Install Hook to create PVC.
3. Run as Helm Post-Delete Hook to remove PVC and Secret.
4. Run as InitContainer to control the component startup sequence.
